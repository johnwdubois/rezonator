--REZONATOR--
Rezonator is a collaborative project to explore the dynamics of human engagement. We strive to capture the 
expressive complexity and creative flux of human interaction in conversation. We also try make the process 
interesting and even fun, for players and researchers alike. Rezonator is an open-source project, offered 
under the MIT License.


--DOWNLOAD--
Either from Rezonator.com/download or from our Github, you can download the newest installation package of 
Rezonator. This package includes an executable file of the Rezonator main program, a folder 
containing 60 REZ files of the Santa Barbara Corpus, an extension used for file management, and a GameMaker 
license agreement.	


--INSTALLATION--
Once the installation executable is activated, it will walk you through a few simple steps: accepting the
GameMaker user agreement, selecting which components to install, and choosing the install location. The 
installation itself should take no more than a minute, and allow you to start up Rezonator immediately.


--GETTING STARTED--
The first screen of Rezonator will prompt you to either begin a new project or open an already created one. 
If this is your first time using Rezonator, choose "New Project", then open one or more of the 60 included 
REZ files to get started.
