2	Navigating the Main Screen
=====
The main screen of Rezonator is our visual representation of the text imported delineated into tokens and units. 

![image45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34769184/132994278-f4c43f7d-36f2-4c4b-a626-cf16ab463f9e.png)

The main screen consists of four major sections:
* The Workspace where the document is displayed and edited
* The Tool Pane is the vertical section on the right
* The Navigation Window is above both of those
* Finally the Menu Bar is at the top of the screen

## 2.1 Workspace 

The Workspace is a malleable area where the user can view token and unit level fields. This Is also the actionable space where most data annotation will occur. The workspace can be scrolled using the scroll bar or by using other quick navigation hotkeys linked to the arrow keys. The workspace can be used to show different sections of the document based on what the user is trying to filter on.

### 2.1.1 Word Editing

**Word Editing** allows you to modify the words or tokens on the main screen, allowing for more annotation options. Use cases of Word Editing include splitting compound words to annotate the pieces separately, and inserting placeholder or implicit words like the Zero morpheme.

To begin Word Editing, **Right Mouse Click** on a new word/token in the Main Screen. This will open a dropdown menu containing the options **New Token,  Delete Token,** and **Tag**. 
 - **Note:** When the selected word is in a Chain, this dropdown will have an additional option called **Delete Link**. This does not pertain to Word Editing.

The New Word option allows you to insert a new word into the discourse. Selecting this option will activate another dropdown with the options <0>, <ZERO>, <PRO>, and **Custom**.
 - <0>, <ZERO>, and <PRO> are all default new words. Selecting one of these defaults will open the New Word Pop-up Window, with the text input filled in with the selected word. Selecting the Custom option will open this window as well, with the text input blank.
 - With the new word typed in the text input box, clicking the “OK” button will insert the New Word before the selected word. Toggling the **Insert Before** button will have the New Word inserted after the selected word.
- The **Delete Token** option will delete the selected token.
- The **Tag** option will allow you to tag the **token** or the chain the token is associated with on both the **entry** and **chain** level.

 Tags can be further managed in the **Tag** pane on the Navigation window

### 2.1.2 Text Direction

 Two forms of text direction are currently supported in Rezonator, **Right-To-Left** and **Left-To-Right**. The text direction of the text is chosen by default based on the type of characters imported. If they require Right-To-Left then it will be enabled by default. This option can always be toggled in by using the “L” key, or using the view drop down.

## 2.2 Tool Pane

### 2.2.1 Tools
