	lineID needs to be called unitID
	"line" is display variable
	lineGrid should be called unitGrid
	
	new lineGrid:
		col: displayRow
		col: wordIDList
		col: lineState
	lineGrid can be resized, rows can be combined, etc

	dynamicWordGrid

2018-05-29
	dynamicWordGrid_colX --> dymamocWprdGrid_colPixelX

	wordString --> wordToken

	new column in dynamicWordGrid called dynamicWordGrid_colLineWordSeq

	page up / page down feature --> hop one screen of dialog
	CTRL+pgup / CTRL+pgdn --> hop entire dialog

	for up/down, it only goes fast once held down button


	TEST FOLLOWING:
		-shuffle lines
		-shuffle lineWordSeq
		-combine/merge lines
		-be able to return to normal

	comment more!

	gridView for lineGrid and dynamicWordGrid up top (with headers)
	
	get all lines back (line 8 on .sbc011 is missing?)	

	chain system that works with only one chain object
		-possibly a grid that contains lists of Word IDs?

	colPositionCol -> colDisplayCol
	colLineWordSeq - > colDisplayWordSeq
	colX -> colPixelX
	colStringDisplay -> colDisplayString
	colInChainsList -> colInChainList

	colUnit -> colUnitID

	delete chainIDType


	headers on gridViewMini

	allowing multiple discourses

	gridView system:
		wordGrid & dynamicWordGrid view together, scroll together
		unitGrid & lineGrid view together, scroll together
		unitGrid & wordGrid view together, scroll together

	stack:
	list of units
	when drawLine(), we check if any of the words in that line contain
	a unit that is within a stack




	in chains:
		sorting, deleting
	when person adds to chain, sort then

	click times

	chainOut -> chainList
	chainIn -> chainContents

	obj_panelPane -> obj_pane

	get rid of chainIDType

	chains: sorting!
	filtering!

	chainGrids based off of linkGrid

	only have pickwhip when you have focused link

	not have another tool's pickwhip when on a different tool

	not be able to see chains in searchgrid

	two of the same chain on same word

	-chainGrids based off linkGrid
	-zero indexing
	-default sort order for filter
	-peek feature
	-between -> tween

	add to dynamicWordGrid
	-focus
	-show
	-flag (boolean, default: false)

	chains follow words better (when filtering)

	add shape variable to control object
