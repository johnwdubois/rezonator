	instead of phrase, call it span
	allow for multiple lines in span
	displayGrid: usually adopts from lineGrid	

	lag happens over time
	lag doesnt happen at end?

	open up multiple files

	lineID needs to be called unitID
	"line" is display variable
	lineGrid should be called unitGrid
	
	new lineGrid:
		col: displayRow
		col: wordIDList
		col: lineState
	lineGrid can be resized, rows can be combined, etc

	dynamicWordGrid

2018-05-29
	dynamicWordGrid_colX --> dymamocWprdGrid_colPixelX

	wordString --> wordToken
	wordStringDT --> wordTranscript

	new column in dynamicWordGrid called dynamicWordGrid_colLineWordSeq

	page up / page down feature --> hop one screen of dialog
	CTRL+pgup / CTRL+pgdn --> hop entire dialog

	for up/down, it only goes fast once held down button


	TEST FOLLOWING:
		-shuffle lines
		-shuffle lineWordSeq
		-combine/merge lines
		-be able to return to normal

2018-06-05
	comment more!

	gridView for lineGrid and dynamicWordGrid up top (with headers)
	
	get all lines back (line 8 on .sbc011 is missing?)	

	chain system that works with only one chain object
		-possibly a grid that contains lists of Word IDs?

2018-06-08
	colPositionCol -> colDisplayCol
	colLineWordSeq - > colDisplayWordSeq
	colX -> colPixelX
	colStringDisplay -> colDisplayString
	colInChainsList -> colInChainList

	colUnit -> colUnitID

	delete chainIDType


	headers on gridViewMini

	allowing multiple discourses
		- put discourse # to left of unit #pp

	.exe of new rezonator

	work on chains 

2018-06-12
	for speaker labels:
		-hue is unique
		-sat & val are within range

2018-07-06
	for speaker labels:
		turn down saturation
		color wheel that cycles, but it offsets every cycle

	search for word, align by centering

2018-07-10
	in searching:
		wildcard characters (*)
		only search for 
		searching the: 206 repeats 3 times--->
			if there are multiple instances of the same word in a unit,
			have that line repeat that number of times, each time showing a different word
			
		color text of the word searched for
		
		COMMENTS

	gridView system:
		wordGrid & dynamicWordGrid view together, scroll together
		unitGrid & lineGrid view together, scroll together
		unitGrid & wordGrid view together, scroll together

	stack:
	list of units
	when drawLine(), we check if any of the words in that line contain
	a unit that is within a stack




	in chains:
		sorting, deleting
	when person adds to chain, sort then

	click times

	chainOut -> chainList
	chainIn -> chainContents

	obj_panelPane -> obj_pane

	get rid of chainIDType


2018-07-19
	word that appears twice in the same line: center on different word for each
	scrollbar: put minimum size, add up/down buttons
	gridView: when you click on something, it shows full string of hovered cell

	stack pane: relevant information shown
	stacks: apply correct information when adding stack in search



	scrollbar in panes

	dont create chains if im outside of the panel

	chains: sorting!
	filtering!

	chainGrids based off of linkGrid

	only have pickwhip when you have focused link

	not have another tool's pickwhip when on a different tool

	not be able to see chains in searchgrid

	two of the same chain on same word

	-chainGrids based off linkGrid
	-zero indexing
	-default sort order for filter
	-peek feature
	-between -> tween

	add to dynamicWordGrid
	-focus
	-show
	-flag (boolean, default: false)

	chains follow words better (when filtering)

	add shape variable to control object

2018-08-14

	fix searching
	include shapeText in search ability

	add to dynamicWordGrid
	-focus
	-show
	-flag (boolean, default: false)

	ability to delete from chain (mark link as dead)

	RezChain 1 -> Rez 1
	AnaphChain -> Track

	be able to modify column sizes in chainContents

	in chainContents utterance column, have it be beginning and end of sentence with dots in the middle

	rezChains: try to make lines as vertical as possible (dont go thru center of word)

	rectangular border around words

	in textShape, tighten it up a bit

	change graphic for filter

2018-08-20

	DELETING STACKS

	make scrollbar in chainList and chainContents hop

	when deleting from word 

	default sort for user's view of the chain is UnitID then place

	in chainContents:
		1st col: unitID
		2nd col: place
		3rd col: text
	resize columns in chainContents

	dont create chains from clicks in the chainWindow

	going past the last line (jump to last line)

	kill chain if every word in it is dead
	if i hit escape on chain with 1 word, mark that link as dead
	1 word chains can only exist with whip!

	allow 1-line stack

	when we set displayRows, run through chains to reset their positions

	if user clicks on link, if that word is not on screen, jump to it
	pickwhip comes out of focused link

	resume chain by clicking on word
	clicking on word in main screen will focus it if it is already in proper chain

	dialog box before putting word in 2 chains of same tier

2018-08-23

	gets rid of border from word when hitting escape to delete chain

	page up/page down for grid view


	when you are in chain, and you click on other chain of same tier, it does NOT add a link

	if you click on word in chain, it would switch you to that tool

	test for duplicates

	continue button -> "Go!" button

	import discourse -> "open file" becomes "open another"

	progress bar


	wordGrid: add colUser and colDead

2018-08-31
	-soft word grid


	-change unitGrid -> unit

	-insert wordID into lineGrid


	-user flag in dynaWord
