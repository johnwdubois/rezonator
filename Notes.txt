	gridView system:
		wordGrid & dynamicWordGrid view together, scroll together
		unitGrid & lineGrid view together, scroll together
		unitGrid & wordGrid view together, scroll together

	stack:
	list of units
	when drawLine(), we check if any of the words in that line contain
	a unit that is within a stack




	in chains:
		sorting, deleting
	when person adds to chain, sort then

	click times

	chainOut -> chainList
	chainIn -> chainContents

	obj_panelPane -> obj_pane

	get rid of chainIDType

	chains: sorting!
	filtering!

	chainGrids based off of linkGrid

	only have pickwhip when you have focused link

	not have another tool's pickwhip when on a different tool

	not be able to see chains in searchgrid

	two of the same chain on same word

	-chainGrids based off linkGrid
	-zero indexing
	-default sort order for filter
	-peek feature
	-between -> tween

	add to dynamicWordGrid
	-focus
	-show
	-flag (boolean, default: false)

	chains follow words better (when filtering)

	AnaphChain -> Track

	be able to modify column sizes in chainContents

	in chainContents utterance column, have it be beginning and end of sentence with dots in the middle

	rezChains: try to make lines as vertical as possible (dont go thru center of word)

	rectangular border around words

	in textShape, tighten it up a bit

	change graphic for filter

2018-08-20

	DELETING STACKS

	make scrollbar in chainList and chainContents hop

	when deleting from word 

	default sort for user's view of the chain is UnitID then place

	in chainContents:
		1st col: unitID
		2nd col: place
		3rd col: text
	resize columns in chainContents

	dont create chains from clicks in the chainWindow

	going past the last line (jump to last line)

	kill chain if every word in it is dead
	if i hit escape on chain with 1 word, mark that link as dead
	1 word chains can only exist with whip!

	allow 1-line stack

	when we set displayRows, run through chains to reset their positions

	if user clicks on link, if that word is not on screen, jump to it
	pickwhip comes out of focused link

	resume chain by clicking on word
	clicking on word in main screen will focus it if it is already in proper chain

	dialog box before putting word in 2 chains of same tier

2018-08-23

	page up/page down for grid view


	when you are in chain, and you click on other chain of same tier, it does NOT add a link

	if you click on word in chain, it would switch you to that tool

	test for duplicates

	continue button -> "Go!" button

	import discourse -> "open file" becomes "open another"

	users can only create rezChains or cliques in default sort
	chains only align in defaul sort
	
2018-09-29
	when adding to a clique, if a break is detected, newest word to add to chain doesnt have pushing rights
	
	if you click on rez tool while on different line sort, ask user if they want to restore default line sort
	
	when adding to a clique, and break is detected, go through the clique's chainList, and unalign chains 1 by 1 starting with the shortest chain and checking for breaks again
	each time
	
	add aligned column to dynamicWordGrid, when adding to a clique and break is detected, go through chains in clique 1 by 1 unaligning them to test which chain causes a break, 
	now you know what chain caused the break, now see which word in that chain causes a break, mark that word as strong bond (unalignable)
	
	
	take away break detection developer messages
	
	remove chain from clique if the chain is deleted
	
	first word in chain we do not need to check for break

	when finding minimum and maximum display column values for cliques (flanks), only look at words within the chains within the clique
	
	words within flank in clique recieve light background color rectangle

	simple race test: before pulling (aligning) chain, check every word in chain to see if it has a blank space to the left. if so, pull entire
	chain back (or dont pull at all?)

	clique box: find leftmost column in clique from words in chains. clique box starts one column to the left of that. this is so we can detect
	break in leftmost chain
