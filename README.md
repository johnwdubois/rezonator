## Rezonator: Dynamics of human engagement
Welcome to Rezonator! 

Rezonator is a project to explore the dynamics of resonance and engagement in dialogue. We strive to capture the expressive complexity and creativity unleashed when people resonate in conversational interaction. We try make the process of inquiry interesting and fun, for players and researchers alike.
