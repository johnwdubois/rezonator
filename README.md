## Rezonator: Dynamics of human engagement

Welcome to Rezonator!

Rezonator is a collaborative project to explore the dynamics of human engagement. We strive to capture the expressive complexity and creative flux of human interaction in conversation. We also try make the process interesting and even fun, for players and researchers alike. Rezonator is an open-source project, offered under the [MIT License](https://github.com/johnwdubois/rezonator_v2/blob/master/LICENSE).

Rezonator is both a game platform and a research tool. Unifying factors that link Rezonator's gaming and research functions include:

* built on the fundamental principles of dialogic resonance (DuBois 2014, [_Towards a Dialogic Syntax_](https://github.com/johnwdubois/rezonator_v2/blob/master/DuBois_2014_Towards_a_Dialogic_Syntax.pdf))
* sensitivity to dynamic aspects of language in conversational interaction
* attention to details of linguistic form and meaning
* focus on intuitive visualization of language in use
* commitment to an insightful user experience

As a research tool, it is designed for:

* resonance analytics
* discourse analysis
* anaphora/coreference
* concordance search
* linguistic analysis
* data visualization

As a game design platform, the focus is on creating Games With a Purpose (GWAP), with appealing game play and clear visualization. The code is written in GameMaker Language (GML) using  GameMaker Studio 2. An example of a game we are building with Rezonator is:

* [RezTet](https://github.com/johnwdubois/rezonator_v2/wiki/6.1--RezTet:-A-game-of-words-in-all-the-right-places) (under development)
